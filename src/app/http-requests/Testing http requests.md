# Testing HTTP requests

You can use the `HttpClientTestingModule` to test your api requests by injecting the `HttpTestingController` and setting up responses to your HTTP calls.

Have a look at the [http-requests service](http-requests.service.spec.ts) and it's [tests](http-requests.service.spec.ts) to see how to use the `HttpClientTestingModule`.
